    <p> Last year there were 400.000 tourists taking part in this amazing festival and most of them were really happy with it. Tomorrowland was the place where they could express their true self and enjoy the best music from all around the globe. Not only that, they get the chance to meet famous artist in person and also have the opportunity to meet and make new friends. Throughout the week, the festival stays true to it style and name, each day brought a different kind of atmosphere and each is as fascinating as the other. They say "nobody can tell what the future holds" and that saying is perfect for "Tomorrowland" because nobody can know what tomorrow shows going to be like. </p>
